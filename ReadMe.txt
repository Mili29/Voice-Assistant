Voice Assistant:=

In this program,
	We used speech_recognition library to recognize the voice & pyttsx3 to convert speech to text. These are main libraries.
Other libraries over here...
			1)os := 
				To open any application of the device to our program.
			2)datetime :=
				To reply the current time 
			3)wikipedia :=
				To extract information from wikipedia.
			4)webbrowser :=
				To get our search result in particular default browser.
				
				
	Here, we included the applications which are regularly used by us.Anyone can include more tasks accordingly one's comfort.
	
	One more point is...
		We made this program to do one task at a time.To perform more than one tasks, we need to rerun the program.
	But if we want to make this process occur more than once...
		The change is "if 1: -> while 1: "
		
This is all about our voice assistant.First we asked user to insert query which he wants to perform and acted accordingly.
